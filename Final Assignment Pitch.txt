Final Assignment Pitch
Micro-Mistake
Final Product
The player is a mad scientist who trapped himself in his backyard after accidentally injecting a shrink serum into himself.
The objective of the game is to find the required items to build a device to reverse the effects back to normal before he shrinks into oblivion.
There will be 3-5 objects that the player must collect in different locations around the map.  
The map will have areas that you can only get to if you are small enough.
There will also be an item that the player can collect to pause the shrinking effect for a short amount of time.
